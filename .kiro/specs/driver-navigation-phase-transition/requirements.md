# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues in the driver navigation system where the map does not properly reset and transition when a driver picks up a passenger. Currently, when a driver completes the pickup phase and needs to navigate to the drop-off destination, the map continues to show the pickup route and geofence instead of clearing them and displaying the new route to the destination.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a driver, I want the navigation map to automatically reset and show the route to the destination when I pick up a passenger, so that I can navigate efficiently to the drop-off location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the driver transitions from 'at-pickup' to 'picking-up' phase THEN the system SHALL clear the current route display
2. WHEN the driver transitions from 'picking-up' to 'to-destination' phase THEN the system SHALL calculate and display a new route from pickup location to destination
3. WHEN the new destination route is calculated THEN the system SHALL center the map view to show the complete route
4. WHEN transitioning to destination navigation THEN the system SHALL restart the navigation service with the new origin and destination coordinates

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a driver, I want the pickup geofence to disappear after I pick up the passenger, so that I only see relevant navigation information for the current phase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the driver is in 'to-pickup' or 'at-pickup' phase THEN the system SHALL display the pickup geofence
2. WHEN the driver transitions to 'to-destination' phase THEN the system SHALL hide the pickup geofence
3. WHEN the driver is in 'to-destination' or 'at-destination' phase THEN the system SHALL only display the destination geofence
4. WHEN the driver completes the trip THEN the system SHALL hide all geofences

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a driver, I want the navigation instructions to update immediately when transitioning to destination navigation, so that I receive accurate turn-by-turn directions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the driver transitions to 'to-destination' phase THEN the system SHALL clear previous navigation instructions
2. WHEN the new destination route is calculated THEN the system SHALL provide updated turn-by-turn instructions
3. WHEN navigation restarts for destination THEN the system SHALL announce the first instruction via voice guidance
4. WHEN the route calculation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and provide retry option

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a driver, I want the map camera to smoothly transition to show the destination route, so that I have a clear view of where I need to go.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transitioning to destination navigation THEN the system SHALL animate the camera to show the full route from pickup to destination
2. WHEN the route is displayed THEN the system SHALL set appropriate zoom level to show the entire route
3. WHEN navigation begins THEN the system SHALL transition to follow mode centered on driver location
4. WHEN the camera transition completes THEN the system SHALL enable normal navigation camera behavior

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a driver, I want the system to handle phase transitions reliably even if there are temporary network or GPS issues, so that my navigation experience is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a phase transition occurs during poor network connectivity THEN the system SHALL retry route calculation up to 3 times
2. WHEN GPS signal is temporarily lost during transition THEN the system SHALL maintain the last known position until signal is restored
3. WHEN route calculation fails repeatedly THEN the system SHALL display offline navigation options or manual directions
4. WHEN the system recovers from errors THEN the system SHALL automatically resume normal navigation functionality
